## Contribution Guidelines
Please follow these practices to make it easy for the reviewers to manage the project and for the contributors to contribute.

* If you fix a bug, want to implement a new feature, want to refactor the code etc,  then first open an issue, describe about the issue and then go ahead to make a MR.
* If you want to work on a issue, drop in a comment on the issue thread, create a Merge Request by following the pattern ``` Fixes #<issue number> <Relevent MR title>``` and Also include ```Fixes #<issue number>``` in the description of the MR.
* Before creating a MR, run ```flutter format lib``` in 'monumento_module' directory to format your code.
* The merge request will not get merged until and unless there is a issue created for the same.
* Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
* If the MR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the merge request description.
