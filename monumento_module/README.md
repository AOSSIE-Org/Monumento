## Contribution guide :
Please follow these practices to make it easy for the reviewers to manage the project and for the contributors to contribute.

If you fix a bug, want to implement a new feature, want to refactor the code etc, then first open an issue, describe about the issue and then go ahead to make a MR.
If you want to work on a issue, drop in a comment on the issue thread, create a Merge Request by following the pattern  Fixes `#<issue number> <Relevent MR title>` and Also include Fixes `#<issue number>` in the description of the MR.
Before creating a MR, run flutter format lib in 'monumento_module' directory to format your code.
The merge request will not get merged until and unless there is a issue created for the same.
Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
If the MR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the merge request description.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.
