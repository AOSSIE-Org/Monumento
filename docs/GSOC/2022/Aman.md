## Monumento


The goal of this year's project was

- To make UI/UX better for the user.
- To make Community Page.
- To make Chat feature.


### Work done


1. New UI/UX of Login, Signup, monuments Screen
2. Implementation of Community Section
3. Implementation of Chat Section
4. Implementation of Deep links
5. Implementation of post share feature
6. Upgrading the dependency.
7. Removal of depricated code.
8. Increasing the support SDK version

Initially, the project ideas were only to add a Community section in the app and to make the chat section, but I also saw the need to refactor the code into a scalable and maintainable architecture. We also introduced deep links and upgraded the support for the higher versions in android application.


The structuring on firebase firestore is also done to add the feature and make it work fluently.


### Deep view into the technology.


I mainly worked on the Flutter module of the Native Android app. I kept the use of packages to a minimum to eliminate the dependencies of the app.
